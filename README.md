## About
Eceptionist-A smart receptionist is a facial recognition-based monitoring system that deals with the combination of office/ functions usually related to managing information related to attendance and scheduling a meeting as per the availability of the person and also maintaining a record of the person who is visiting the designated place on a particular day. The modern history of management began with the typewriter and the copy machine, which industrialized ahead manual tasks. Our Receptionist system is progressively understood as a tool that refers not just to the computerization of tasks but to the conversion of information to electronic
form as well. Our Receptionist-A smart and intelligent system is based on a real-time facial recognition system that recognizes a person and attends to their request and respectively makes arrangements to make their requirement fulfilled.
